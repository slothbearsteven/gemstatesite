<!-- Include centered contact information. for styling due to lack of pictures, suggest a color scheme to prevent the page from just seeming to be a white blob with text.

Contact information should include the following:
email (if multiple for certain things, will need to specify. IE an email for estimates, and an email for questions and FAQ)
phone number
